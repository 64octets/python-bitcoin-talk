This is a small sample Django web application demonstrating transactions using
BitCoin.

This demo requires the django package.

bitcoind should be running and accessible on port 8333.

The rpcuser and rpcpassword parameters in ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf need to
match the user and password in tribapp/bt.py.

To run, execute "python manage.py runserver" from this directory, then point
your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8000/

URLs are defined in urls.py. They point to view methods in tribapp/views.py,
which render html using templates in the templates directory. The file 
tribapp/bt.py contains the BitCoin interface functions. 

The demonstration consists of three web pages. The index page allows user
login. The user page displays a user pay-to BitCoin address, and payment
to-date. The summary page shows all users with total paid, current balance,
and the number of confirmations for the most recent transaction. The 'harvest'
function transfers all outstanding balances to a specified BitCoin address.
